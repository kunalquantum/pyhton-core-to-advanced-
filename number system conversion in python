number system conversion 
there are many number system 
like binary, decimal, hexadecimal,octal,binary coded decimal, gray code,excess three etc

conversion decimal into binary 
we have a function bin()
syntax: bin(number)
>>> a=988
>>> bin(a)
'0b1111011100'

conversion of binary to decimal
we will use syntax: 0bnumber_in_binary
>>> 0b10101
21

conversion of decimal to octal
we have a function oct(number)
>>> oct(67)
'0o103'(here our answer is after  0o which is 103)

we can use 0o to convert octal to decimal
we will use syntax: 0onumber_in_octal
>>> 0o67
55

conversion of decimal to hexadecimal
we have a function hex(number)
>>> hex(34)
'0x22'(here 0x is the code after which we have our result 22)

we can use 0x to convert number form hex to decimal
we will use syntax: 0xnumber_in_hex
>>> 0x233
563
